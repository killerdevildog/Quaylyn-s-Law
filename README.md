# Quaylyn's Law

## A Universal Law of Discovery Under Uncertainty

**Quaylyn's Law** is a fundamental principle that reveals a critical truth about how knowledge emerges when information is incomplete. It states:

> *When information is incomplete, movement based on certainty increases failure; movement based on directional error-reduction increases discovery.*

### The Problem: Certainty is Brittle

Most systems and people operate by assuming something is true and committing to it—this is **certainty-based reasoning**. When information is incomplete (which is nearly always), holding a single truth as absolutely correct leads to:

- Premature commitment to incomplete models
- Locked search spaces that resist correction
- Amplified errors as false assumptions propagate forward
- System collapse when reality contradicts the assumed truth

**Certainty halts search. Direction sustains it.**

### The Solution: Bisection and Trisection

Instead of declaring what is true, Quaylyn's Law advocates for **elimination-based methods** like bisection and trisection:

- **Don't claim to know the answer**—instead, eliminate what is clearly worse
- **Don't commit to correctness**—instead, move toward improvement
- **Don't force binary true/false judgments**—instead, compare and reduce error

This approach:
- Remains reversible
- Adapts as information emerges
- Reduces failure by avoiding premature certainty
- Discovers truth through progressive elimination rather than early assertion

### Key Insights

- **Elimination precedes explanation** — Remove what doesn't work before claiming what does
- **Reversibility outperforms confidence** — Tentative steps are safer than certain commitments
- **Early commitment predicts later failure** — The sooner you claim certainty, the more likely you are wrong

### Applications

- Software debugging and system architecture
- Artificial intelligence reasoning and preventing hallucination
- Historical and textual analysis where evidence is incomplete
- Theology and philosophy under ambiguity
- Any domain where the complete truth is not yet accessible

### What Makes It Different

Unlike frameworks that assume you already have a model (Occam's Razor, Bayesian inference, the scientific method), **Quaylyn's Law operates before models exist**. It's a law about how to move forward when you don't yet know what's true—by avoiding certainty and using directional elimination instead.

### Mathematical Expression

Quaylyn's Law can be expressed mathematically:

$$F_c = \frac{C \cdot I^{-1}}{R}$$

Where failure under certainty ($F_c$) increases as commitment ($C$) rises and information completeness ($I$) decreases, while reversibility ($R$) mitigates failure. This proves that **when information is incomplete, certainty guarantees failure**.
